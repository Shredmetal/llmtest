# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.2.0b1] - 2024-11-30

#### Breaking Changes
1. Renamed base error class:
- Old: LLMTestError
- New: LLMAppTestError
- No impact on users as this is just a template class other errors inherit from

#### Deprecations
1. Deprecated `SemanticAssertion` in favor of `BehavioralAssertion`:
- Same underlying implementation
- Only terminology change
- Using `SemanticAssertion` will trigger deprecation warnings:
  - stderr prints
  - pytest warnings

#### New Features
1. Custom Prompt Injection:
- New capability to override SystemMessage and HumanMessage
- Extra friction implemented through required `AsserterPrompts` object
- Marked as dangerous action in documentation

#### Configuration Updates
1. Added `LLM_TIMEOUT` environment variable:
- Sets `request_timeout` in default ChatOpenAI object
- Sets `default_request_timeout` in default ChatAnthropic object
- Can be passed directly to asserter as `timeout` argument
- Recommended to use environment variable instead of direct parameter

### Summary
This release focuses on:
1. Better terminology (Semantic â†’ Behavioral)
2. Advanced configuration options
3. Custom prompt capabilities (with safety guardrails)
4. Improved timeout handling
