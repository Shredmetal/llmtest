## Contributing

This project is at an early stage and aims to be an important testing library for LLM applications. 

Want to contribute? Great! Some areas we're looking for help:
- Additional LLM provider support
- Performance optimizations
- Test coverage improvements
- Documentation
- CI/CD integration examples
- Test result caching
- Literally anything else you can think of, I'm all out of ideas, I'm not even sure starting this project was a smart one.

Please:
1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch
3. Submit a Pull Request

For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change, or YOLO in a PR, bonus points if you can insult me in a way that makes me laugh.

Please adhere to clean code principles and include appropriate tests... or else. üó°Ô∏è
