# llmtest

A semantic testing framework for LLM applications that uses LLMs to validate semantic equivalence in test outputs. 

âœ¨ Test your LLM apps in minutes, not hours

ðŸš€ CI/CD ready out of the box

ðŸ’° Cost-effective testing solution

ðŸ”§ No infrastructure needed

## Why llmtest?

Testing LLM applications is challenging because:
- Outputs are non-deterministic
- Semantic meaning matters more than exact matches
- Traditional testing approaches don't work well
- Integration into CI/CD pipelines is complex

llmtest solves these challenges by:
- Using LLMs to evaluate semantic equivalence
- Providing a clean, maintainable testing framework
- Offering simple CI/CD integration
- Supporting multiple LLM providers

## Quick Example

```
from llmtest.semanticassert.semantic_assert import SemanticAssertion

semantic_assert = SemanticAssertion() 
semantic_assert.assert_semantic_match(actual="Hello Alice, how are you?", 
                                      expected_behavior="A polite greeting addressing Alice" 
                                      )
```
