# Format Compliance - Brute Force Validation of Format Compliance

## Overview

This page documents our extensive format compliance testing of llm-app-test. We designed these tests to validate the library's ability to maintain consistent format requirements across diverse use cases.

The test suite demonstrated 100% reliability across 13,000 test executions, with zero format violations detected.

The relevant logs can be found [here](https://github.com/Shredmetal/llmtest/tree/release/0.1.0b5/reliability_testing).

## Test Suite Design

The test suite covers 13 distinct test cases:

- 8 positive test cases
- 5 negative test cases

Each test validates different aspects of format compliance across various content types:

1. Multilingual equivalence
2. Complex technical explanations
3. Contextual understanding
4. Complex sentiment analysis
5. Long-form comparisons
6. Subtle sentiment matching
7. Technical context validation
8. Ambiguous reference handling
9. Temporal context verification
10. Logical implication testing
11. Complex multi-hop reasoning
12. Adversarial content handling
13. Long context understanding

## Test Characteristics

Each test was designed to validate:

- Format compliance
- Response structure
- Error handling
- Edge cases
- Content variations

## Test Results

### Format Compliance

- Zero format violations across 13,000 executions
- Consistent PASS/FAIL behavior
- Proper error handling for negative cases

### Response Reliability

- Consistent format across all test types
- Proper error message formatting
- Stable behavior across multiple runs

## Cost Analysis

Running 13,000 tests using GPT-4o cost approximately US$7.90, demonstrating the economic viability of comprehensive format testing even with large test suites.

## Test Configuration

All tests used library defaults:


```
LLM_PROVIDER=openai
LLM_MODEL=gpt-4o 
LLM_TEMPERATURE=0.0 
LLM_MAX_TOKENS=4096 
LLM_MAX_RETRIES=2 
LLM_TIMEOUT=10.0 # Added for OpenAI in 0.1.0b5 using the underlying Langchain implementation 
```
The `semantic_assert_match` function also saw slight modification:

```
        if result.startswith("FAIL"):
            raise SemanticAssertionError(
                "Semantic assertion failed",
                reason=result.split("FAIL: ")[1]
            )
            
        # Section below added to cause failure in the event of format violation    
            
        elif result.startswith("PASS"):
            pass
        else:
            raise RuntimeError(
                f"Format Non-compliance Detected {result}"
            )
```

The prompts to the asserter LLM (that sits behind `semantic_assert_match`) were:

```
DEFAULT_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are a testing system. Your job is to determine if an actual output matches the expected behavior.

Important: You can only respond with EXACTLY: 
1. 'PASS' if it matches, or 
2. 'FAIL: <reason>' if it doesn't match.

Any other type of response will mean disaster which as a testing system, you are meant to prevent.

Be strict but consider semantic meaning rather than exact wording."""

DEFAULT_HUMAN_PROMPT = """
Expected Behavior: {expected_behavior}

Actual Output: {actual}

Does the actual output match the expected behavior? Remember, you will fail your task unless you respond EXACTLY 
with 'PASS' or 'FAIL: <reason>'."""
```

## Testing Cost

It actually cost us very little.

This is likely due to how we constrained the model: The temperature is set to 0.0, and it has strict instructions to only respond with "PASS" or "FAIL <reason>". This constrains the much more expensive output token usage.

Running the test suite of 13 tests below 100 times (so 1,300 tests), cost us a total of US$0.79, using OpenAI's GPT-4o.

Upon observing the cost of throwing thousands of API calls at OpenAI, we decided to just sod it and throw 13,000 API calls at them for the grand sum of... US$7.90. 

The purpose of these 13,000 runs was primarily to test the reliability of this library insofar as **format violations** were concerned, and get some insight as to the reliability of the semantic comparison.

Based on the testing documented in this page however, we are quite confident that llm-app-test will adhere to the format requirements in most situations and not throw stupid errors by failing to adhere to the requirements. 

Please refer to the other pages of testing reliability, specifically [Semantic Reliability Testing](semantic_reliability.md) and [Semantic Boundary Analysis](semantic_boundary_analysis.md) for more information on reliability testing of the ability of this library to test for semantic equivalence.

        The Roman Empire's rise began with modest origins in central Italy. What started as a small 
        settlement along the Tiber River would eventually become one of history's most influential 
        civilizations. In the early days, Rome was ruled by kings, but this system was overthrown 
        in 509 BCE, giving birth to the Roman Republic.

        During the Republic, Rome expanded its territory through military conquest and diplomatic 
        alliances. The Roman army became increasingly professional, developing innovative tactics 
        and technologies. This military success brought wealth and power, but also internal 
        challenges. Social tensions grew between patricians and plebeians, leading to significant 
        political reforms.

        By the 1st century BCE, the Republic faced severe internal strife. Military commanders 
        like Marius, Sulla, and eventually Julius Caesar accumulated unprecedented power. Caesar's 
        crossing of the Rubicon in 49 BCE marked a point of no return. His assassination in 44 BCE 
        led to another civil war, ultimately resulting in his adopted heir Octavian becoming 
        Augustus, the first Roman Emperor.

        Augustus transformed Rome into an empire while maintaining a facade of republican 
        institutions. He implemented sweeping reforms in administration, military organization, 
        and public works. The Pax Romana that followed brought unprecedented peace and prosperity 
        across the Mediterranean world. Trade flourished, cities grew, and Roman culture spread 
        throughout the empire.
